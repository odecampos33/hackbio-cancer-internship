Immune Checkpoints as Targets for Biomarker Discovery

Biomarkers are biological indicators that can be used to predict a patient’s response to therapy, determine prognosis, and monitor disease progression. Immune checkpoints are crucial biomarkers in cancer care because they provide insights into the tumor's immune evasion mechanisms and help tailor immunotherapy to the individual patient's needs1. Immune checkpoints are integral components of the immune system that regulate the immune response and prevent it from becoming overly aggressive, which could otherwise result in damage to healthy tissues. These checkpoints function through the interaction of proteins on the surface of T cells—key players in the immune system—with corresponding partner proteins on other cells, including some cancer cells2. When a T cell's checkpoint protein binds to its partner on another cell, an inhibitory signal is transmitted to the T cell, effectively turning off its activity. This mechanism is vital for maintaining immune balance, but in the context of cancer, it can allow tumors to evade immune response by exploiting this pathway.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are a class of immunotherapy drugs that work by blocking these checkpoint proteins from binding to their partners2,3. This blockade prevents the inhibitory signal transmission, thereby allowing T cells to remain active and capable of targeting and destroying cancer cells. This therapeutic approach has been a breakthrough in cancer treatment, offering a means to harness the body's own immune system to fight cancer more effectively. 

PD-1 (Programmed cell death protein 1) and its ligand PD-L1 are among the most studied immune checkpoints4,5. Tumor cells can overexpress PD-L1, which binds to PD-1 receptors on T cells, leading to the suppression of T cell activity and allowing the tumor to escape immune destruction. The blockade of this pathway with ICIs, such as pembrolizumab or nivolumab, has shown remarkable results in treating cancers like melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and renal cell carcinoma, with significant improvements in patient survival rates and quality of life6.

The expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells and infiltrating immune cells is a crucial biomarker for selecting patients who are likely to benefit from PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapies. For example, in NSCLC, the level of PD-L1 expression is used to stratify patients, with higher expression levels correlating with a better response to PD-1 inhibitors. This has made PD-L1 expression testing a standard practice, in developed countries before initiating treatment in several cancer types.
