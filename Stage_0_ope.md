biomarker is any measurable biological moiety that can be assessed and measured
as a potential index of either normal or abnormal pathophysiology or
pharmacological responses to some treatment regimen. Every tissue in the body
has a distinct biomolecular make-up, which is known as its biomarkers, which
possess particular features, viz., the levels or activities (the ability of a
gene or protein to carry out a particular body function) of a gene, protein, or
other biomolecules. A biomarker refers to some feature that can be objectively
quantified by various biochemical samples and evaluates the exposure of an
organism to normal or pathological procedures or their response to some drug
interventions. An in-depth and comprehensive realization of the significance of
these biomarkers becomes quite important for the efficient diagnosis of
diseases and for providing the appropriate directions in case of multiple drug
choices being presently available, which can benefit any patient. Presently,
advancements in omics technologies have opened up new possibilities to obtain
novel biomarkers of different types, employing genomic strategies, epigenetics,
metabolomics, transcriptomics, lipid-based analysis, protein studies, etc.
Particular biomarkers for specific diseases, their prognostic capabilities, and
responses to therapeutic paradigms have been applied for screening of various
normal healthy, as well as diseased, tissue or serum samples, and act as
appreciable tools in pharmacology and therapeutics, etc. In this review, we
have summarized various biomarker types, their classification, and monitoring
and detection methods and strategies. Various analytical techniques and
approaches of biomarkers have also been described along with various clinically
applicable biomarker sensing techniques which have been developed in the recent
past. A section has also been dedicated to the latest trends in the formulation
and designing of nanotechnology-based biomarker sensing and detection
developments in this field.&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:[{&quot;dropping-particle&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Ahmad&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Anas&quot;,&quot;non-dropping-particle&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parse-names&quot;:false,&quot;suffix&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;dropping-particle&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Imran&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Mohammad&quot;,&quot;non-dropping-particle&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parse-names&quot;:false,&quot;suffix&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;dropping-particle&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Ahsan&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Haseeb&quot;,&quot;non-dropping-particle&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parse-names&quot;:false,&quot;suffix&quot;:&quot;&quot;}],&quot;container-title&quot;:&quot;Pharmaceutics&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;ITEM-1&quot;,&quot;issue&quot;:&quot;6&quot;,&quot;issued&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[&quot;2023&quot;,&quot;6&quot;,&quot;1&quot;]]},&quot;publisher&quot;:&quot;Multidisciplinary

checkpoint blockade therapy has become a major weapon in fighting cancer.
Antibody drugs, such as anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1, demonstrate obvious advantages
such as broad applicability across cancer types and durable clinical response
when treatment is effective. However, the overall response rates are still
unsatisfying, especially for cancers with low mutational burden. Moreover,
adverse effects, such as autoimmune symptoms and tumor hyperprogression,
present a significant downside in some clinical applications. These challenges
reflect the urgent need to fully understand the basic biology of immune
checkpoints. In this review, we discuss regulation of immune checkpoint
signaling at multiple levels to provide an overview of our current
understanding of checkpoint biology. Topics include the regulation of surface
expression levels for known immune checkpoint proteins via surface delivery,
internalization, recycling, and degradation. Upon reaching the surface,
checkpoints engage in both conventional trans and also cis interactions with
ligands to induce signaling and regulate immune responses. Novel therapeutic
strategies targeting these pathways in addition to classical checkpoint
blockade have recently emerged and been tested in preclinical models, providing
new avenues for developing next-generation
immunotherapies.&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:[{&quot;dropping-particle&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;family&quot;:&quot;He&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Xing&quot;,&quot;non-dropping-particle&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parse-names&quot;:false,&quot;suffix&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;dropping-particle&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Xu&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Chenqi&quot;,&quot;non-dropping-particle&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parse-names&quot;:false,&quot;suffix&quot;:&quot;&quot;}],&quot;container-title&quot;:&quot;Cell

immunologically \&quot;cold\&quot; tumor with low tumor mutation burden, low
expression of PD-L1, sparse T-cell infiltration, and a immunosuppressive tumor
microenvironment (TME). Sipuleucel-T (Provenge) is the first FDA approved
immunotherapeutic agent for the treatment of asymptom-atic or minimally
symptomatic metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC);
demonstrating a benefit in overall survival. However various clinical trials by
immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and their combinations with other drugs
have shown limited responses in mCRPC. Up to now, only a small subset of
patients with mismatch repair deficiency/microsatellite instability high and
CDK12 mutations can clinically benefit from ICIs and/or their combinations with
other agents, such as DNA damage agents. The existence of a large heterogeneity
in genomic alterations and a complex TME in prostate cancer suggests the need
for identifying new immunotherapeutic targets. As well as designing
personalized immunotherapy strategies based on patient-specific molecular
signatures. There is also a need to adjust strategies to overcome histologic barriers
such as tissue hypoxia and dense stroma. The racial differences of
immunological responses between men of diverse ethnicities also merit further
investigation to improve the efficacy of immunotherapy and better patient

immunotherapy has been accompanied by promising results over the past few
years. Programmed Cell Death Protein 1 (PD-1) plays a vital role in inhibiting
immune responses and promoting self-tolerance through modulating the activity
of T-cells, activating apoptosis of antigen-specific T cells and inhibiting
apoptosis of regulatory T cells. Programmed Cell Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) is a
trans-membrane protein that is considered to be a co-inhibitory factor of the
immune response, it can combine with PD-1 to reduce the proliferation of PD-1
positive cells, inhibit their cytokine secretion and induce apoptosis. PD-L1
also plays an important role in various malignancies where it can attenuate the
host immune response to tumor cells. Based on these perspectives, PD-1/PD-L1
axis is responsible for cancer immune escape and makes a huge effect on cancer
therapy. This review is aimed to summarize the role of PD-1 and PD-L1 in

Based on the immense success in clinical trials, ten α-PD-1 (nivolumab,
pembrolizumab, cemiplimab, sintilimab, camrelizumab, toripalimab, tislelizumab,
zimberelimab, prolgolimab, and dostarlimab) and three α-PD-L1 antibodies
(atezolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab) have been approved for various types
of cancers. Nevertheless, the low response rate of α-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy remains
to be resolved. For most cancer patients, PD-1/PD-L1 pathway is not the sole
speed-limiting factor of antitumor immunity, and it is insufficient to motivate
effective antitumor immune response by blocking PD-1/PD-L1 axis. It has been
validated that some combination therapies, including α-PD-1/PD-L1 plus
chemotherapy, radiotherapy, angiogenesis inhibitors, targeted therapy, other
immune checkpoint inhibitors, agonists of the co-stimulatory molecule,
stimulator of interferon genes agonists, fecal microbiota transplantation,
epigenetic modulators, or metabolic modulators, have superior antitumor
efficacies and higher response rates. Moreover, bifunctional or bispecific
antibodies containing α-PD-1/PD-L1 moiety also elicited more potent antitumor
activity. These combination strategies simultaneously boost multiple processes
in cancer-immunity cycle, remove immunosuppressive brakes, and orchestrate an
immunosupportive tumor microenvironment. In this review, we summarized the
synergistic antitumor efficacies and mechanisms of α-PD-1/PD-L1 in combination
with other therapies. Moreover, we focused on the advances of
α-PD-1/PD-L1-based immunomodulatory strategies in clinical studies. Given the
heterogeneity across patients and cancer types, individualized combination
selection could improve the effects of α-PD-1/PD-L1-based immunomodulatory
strategies and relieve treatment
resistance.&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:[{&quot;dropping-particle&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Yi&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Ming&quot;,&quot;non-dropping-particle&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parse-names&quot;:false,&quot;suffix&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;dropping-particle&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Zheng&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Xiaoli&quot;,&quot;non-dropping-particle&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parse-names&quot;:false,&quot;suffix&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;dropping-particle&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Niu&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Mengke&quot;,&quot;non-dropping-particle&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parse-names&quot;:false,&quot;suffix&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;dropping-particle&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Zhu&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Shuangli&quot;,&quot;non-dropping-particle&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parse-names&quot;:false,&quot;suffix&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;dropping-particle&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Ge&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Hong&quot;,&quot;non-dropping-particle&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parse-names&quot;:false,&quot;suffix&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;dropping-particle&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Wu&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Kongming&quot;,&quot;non-dropping-particle&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parse-names&quot;:false,&quot;suffix&quot;:&quot;&quot;}],&quot;container-title&quot;:&quot;Molecular

Tumor cells can overexpress PD-L1, which binds to PD-1 receptors on T cells, leading to the suppression of T cell activity and allowing the tumor to escape immune destruction.

discovery of immune checkpoint proteins such as PD-1/PDL-1 and CTLA-4 represents
a significant breakthrough in the field of cancer immunotherapy. Therefore,
humanized monoclonal antibodies, targeting these immune checkpoint proteins
have been utilized successfully in patients with metastatic melanoma, renal
cell carcinoma, head and neck cancers and non-small lung cancer. The US FDA has
successfully approved three different categories of immune checkpoint
inhibitors (ICIs) such as PD-1 inhibitors (Nivolumab, Pembrolizumab, and
Cemiplimab), PDL-1 inhibitors (Atezolimumab, Durvalumab and Avelumab), and
CTLA-4 inhibitor (Ipilimumab). Unfortunately, not all patients respond
favourably to these drugs, highlighting the role of biomarkers such as Tumour
mutation burden (TMB), PDL-1 expression, microbiome, hypoxia, interferon-γ, and
ECM in predicting responses to ICIs-based immunotherapy. The current study aims
to review the literature and updates on ICIs in cancer
therapy.&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:[{&quot;dropping-particle&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Shiravand&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Yavar&quot;,&quot;non-dropping-particle&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parse-names&quot;:false,&quot;suffix&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;dropping-particle&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Khodadadi&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Faezeh&quot;,&quot;non-dropping-particle&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;parse-names&quot;:false,&quot;suffix&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;dropping-particle&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Kashani&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Seyyed

The expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells and infiltrating immune cells is a crucial biomarker for selecting patients who are likely to benefit from PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapies. For example, in NSCLC, the level of PD-L1 expression is used to stratify patients, with higher expression levels correlating with a better response to PD-1 inhibitors. This has made PD-L1 expression testing a standard practice, in developed countries, before initiating treatment in several cancer types.
